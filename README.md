# NodeClustering
Node Clustering Based on Edge Properties in Directed Graphs


In this project, we developed an algorithm to do node clustering based on edge properties in a directed graph. That is, given a directed graph and a set of edge lables, a new graph will be generated such that all edge lables not inlcluded in the given set of edge lables can be hidden inside clusters. Refer to the documentation file for more explanation. 

To build the project:
  - Go to the build directory
  - run cmake
  - run make
  
 To run the project:
  - run ./cluster < InputFile
